But from __the half of 20% to the last__, the SAT result __doesn't__ seem to be __better__ (except some outlier) => We can suggest that the more student focucs on get better by take many AP test, the worse their result get because they take time to better at AP but not much time to focus on SAT."

    "- In addtion, a class size which have __25 - 35 student/class__ tend to get higher SAT result (by its good positive correlation) => In range of 35 student/class: it's not matter of less or much class size, it's about what method to teaching of schools.\n",

    "- Which borough match this condition? __Manhattan__ and __Queens__\n",
